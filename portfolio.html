			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img id="profile-picture" src="assets/images/Mike-Wolf.png" alt="Michael Wolf" title="Hello, my name is Mike!">
			<p class="lhOneEM">Hi there, my name is Mike! I attended St. John's University for 3 years (2009-2012) where I studied Actuarial Science and Business; I withdrew in my fourth year and came to find something I have a true passion for!</p>
			<br>
			<p class="lhOneEM">I currently work for an independent jewelry appraisal firm - Just Appraisers - as a Developer and Research Analyst. I also freelance as a Developer. I wasn't hired by Just Appraisers to develop their website(s) or applications. I just had an unstoppable urge to digitize their business! So, I took on the challenge! I hit the ground running... the more I progressed the more questions I had. This led to: more research, more answers, more questions, more research, more answers, etc. I learned whatever I could in order to recreate Just Appraiser's web presence. I've spent the past three years studying, rebuilding and implementing a digital brand for Just Appraisers.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="lhOneEM">
			Together, we're forming big ideas and inventing applications that will help the firm work efficiently in order to produce results faster. We've also started to offer their clients helpful web applications.  Whenever we, as an organization, decided to implement new technologies, I have figured out a way to build it. Whether it was an online client portal, a windows forms application to query and update data in our centralized database, or build a network of websites to showcase our different services, I found a way to get it done. These efforts have continued to out-perform the organization's existing business/digital strategies thus increasing our company's revenue.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="lhOneEM">At this juncture I can do some of both: front-end and back-end development. I'm well versed in html5 and css3, have experience in PHP and JS but I am by no means competent, have done a lot of work under the Wordpress roof, and am slowly teaching myself how to develop using the famous-for-scalability: .Net framework.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Up to this point I am self-taught. On January 10, 2017 I started Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to help me work towards becoming a "real" Full-Stack Developer. When I go to work everyday, I run into issues and problems I don't know how to solve. This serves as a constant reminder of how much I don't know. I look forward to learning as much as I can in the Bootcamp and other experiences that lie ahead of me! Contact me if you’d like to work together on your next project.</p>
