			<h2> About Me</h2>
			<img src="" alt="Michael Wolf" title="Hello, my name is Mike!">
			<p>Hi there, my name is Mike! I currently work for an independent jewelry appraisal firm - Just Appraisers - in Manhattan as IT Support, a Developer and Research Analyst. I also freelance as a Developer. I wasn't hired by Just Appraisers to develop their website(s) or applications, I just took it upon myself to add to and improve their web presence and data architecture. I've spent the past three years studying, rebuilding and implementing a digital brand for Just Appraisers. I focused on producing a distinguishable UX/UI... creating a unique identity. Whenever we, as an organization, decided to improve, upgrade and implement new digital technologies, I have figured out a way to build it. Whether it was an online client portal, a windows form application to query data in our centralized database, or build a network of websites to showcase our services, I found a way to get it done and have it out-perform existing strategies to increase our company's revenue.</p>

			<p>At this juncture I specialize in front end development, am well versed in html5 and css3, have experience in PHP and JS but I am by no means competent, have done a lot of work under the Wordpress roof, and am slowly teaching myself how to develop using under the famous-for-scalability: .Net. Up to this point I am self-taught; on January 10, 2017 I started Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to to help me work towards becoming a "real" Full-Stack Developer. When I go to work everyday, I run into issues and problems I don't know how to solve. This serves as a constant reminder of how much I don't know. I look forward to learning as much as I can in the Bootcamp and other experiences that lie ahead of me! Contact me if you’d like to work together on your next project.</p>
